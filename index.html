    <h1>Don't Post Text as an Image!</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Taking a screenshot of your code, terminal, errors or anything fundamentally text-based is counter-productive for
      everyone involved.
    </p>
    <p>This:
        <ol>
            <li>Removes the ability for the content to be indexed by search engines.</li>
            <li>Possibly increases the network traffic required to view the content (Very important for users with constrained internet connections).</li>
            <li>Potentially adds an extra click if the person helping you doesn't enable in-line images.</li>
        </ol>
