    <h1>Don't Post Text as an Image!</h1>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Taking a screenshot of your code, terminal, errors or anything fundamentally text-based is counter-productive for
      everyone involved. The reasons for this are listed below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>People cannot copy/edit.</h3>
        <p>
          When you're asking for help, other users often want to copy your code into their own editing environment so
          they can modify the code and send back a fixed version or highlight mistakes. Posting an image means the only
          way to do this is to painstakingly copying the text.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cannot be indexed.</h3>
        <p>
          Posting questions doesn't just help you, but it also helps all people in the future who search for the same
          question using keywords or error messages. When you post an image of text, the website itself and search
          engines cannot easily index the content for search purposes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Obscures important information.</h3>
        <p>
          When trying to share error messages from terminals, consoles, browser tools, etc. images often cut off
          important parts of the message, especially with long messages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Potentially more expensive.</h3>
        <p>
          A picture isn't always worth a thousand words. Posting an image may result in a higher cost for users on
          metered connections. Some users may even have images disabled completely on platforms such as Discord or
          Slack. Be thoughtful of those who may not have unlimited internet access.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How do I post code properly?</h2>
    <p>
      Most platforms have settled on <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a> as
      the preferred formatting language:
    </p>
    <pre>
```js
lines.forEach(function(title) {
  innerHtml += '<tr class="title"><th>' + title + '</th></tr>';
});
```
    </pre>
    <p>And Stackoverflow uses 4-spaces of indentation:</p>
    <pre>
    lines.forEach(function(title) {
      innerHtml += '<tr class="title"><th>' + title + '</th></tr>';
    });
    </pre>
    <p>
      Hopefully this has been informative. Now whenever you're helping someone and they share an image of their code or
      error messages, help them anyway but direct them here so they don't make the same mistake next time!
